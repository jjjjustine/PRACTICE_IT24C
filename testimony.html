           <h1>My Testimony</h1>
           <h2> Learning to create web pages with HTML and CSS has been a truly rewarding journey, though it came with its own set of challenges. Initially, the idea of building a website seemed overwhelming. I started with HTML, which is the basic building block of web pages. HTML allowed me to set up the structure of a web page. I learned how to use different tags to add headings, paragraphs, images, and links. This was the first step in turning my ideas into something tangible on the web.
            After getting a handle on HTML, I moved on to CSS. While HTML helped me create the content of my web pages, CSS was essential for making them look attractive. Learning CSS was both exciting and difficult. I discovered how to change the appearance of my web pages by adjusting fonts, colors, and layouts. It was fascinating to see how a few lines of code could transform a plain page into something visually appealing. However, mastering CSS wasn't straightforward. I faced challenges with understanding how to position elements correctly, manage spacing with margins and padding, and ensure everything was aligned properly.
            One of the biggest hurdles was ensuring that my design was consistent across all the pages of my website. I had to make sure that the same styles applied to every page, which required careful attention to detail and a lot of testing. Linking the pages together and keeping a unified look was a complex task, but it was rewarding to see the finished result.
            Despite the difficulties, creating a website with HTML and CSS has been a great learning experience. I’ve gained valuable skills in web development and increased my confidence in building simple, functional websites. I’m excited to continue learning and to take on more advanced projects in the future.</h2>
